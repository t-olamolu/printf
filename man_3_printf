.SH _PRINTF()

.SH NAME
.B printf

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"

.B int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
- The function _printf produces a standard output according to a format.
- Much like the C standard library function printf, it can receive a variable number of arguments.

.SH Format of the format string
- The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state.
.TP
.SH Flag characters
- The character % is followed by zero or more of the following flags:
.B %c & %u
- prints a character
.br
.B %%
- prints a %
.br
.B %d & %i
- prints an integer
.br
.B %s
- prints a string
.br
.B %b
- prints a binary, custom specifier
.br
.B %o
- prints an octal number
.br
.B %x
- prints a hexadecimal number
.br
.B %X
- prints a hexadecimal in uppercase
.br
.B %u
- prints a character
.br
.B %S
- prints a %
.br
.B %p
- prints an address
.br
.B %r
- prints a string in reverse
.br
.B %R
- prints a string in rot13
.br
.B #
- The value should be converted to an "alternate form". For o conversions, the first character of the output string is made zero (by prefixing a 0 if it was not zero already). For x and X conversions, a nonzero result has the string "0x" (or "0X" for X conversions) prepended to it. For a, A, e, E, f, F, g, and G conversions, the result will always contain a decimal point, even if no digits follow it (normally, a decimal point appears in the results of those conversions only if a digit follows). For g and G conversions, trailing zeros are not removed from the result as they would otherwise be. For other conversions, the result is undefined.
.br
.B 0
- The value should be zero padded. For d, i, o, u, x, X, a, A, e, E, f, F, g, and G conversions, the converted value is padded on the left with zeros rather than blanks. If the 0 and - flags both appear, the 0 flag is ignored. If a precision is given with a numeric conversion (d, i, o, u, x, and X), the 0 flag is ignored. For other conversions, the behavior is undefined.
.br
.B ' '(space)
- A blank should be left before a positive number (or empty string) produced by a signed conversion.

.SH Length modifier
- Here, "integer conversion" stands for d,i,o,u,x, or X conversion
.br

.SH Conversion specifiers
- A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
- The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

.SH BUGS
.B '-', '+', ' '(space)
flags work almost flawlessly, but still having issues. Report bugs to https://github.com/t-olamolu/printf.

.SH EXIT STATUS
Return success unless an invalid option is given or a write or assignment error occurs.
